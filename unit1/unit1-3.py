### First, create a variable named "name" and set it equal to a name


### Now, let's print "Hi!, My name is {name}!" to the console where {name} is your variable.



### Second, let's create another variable named color and set it equal to a color.


### Let's print "My favorite color is {color}." to the console!


### Third, let's create a variable named age and set it equal to a number


### Let's print "I am {age} years old!" to the console... but in order to do that, we have to force "age" to become a string. This is called casting and we do it by typing str(age).
print("I am " + str('''What goes here???''') + " years old!")


### Home stretch! let's create two more variables: work, and favorite_thing. Set work equal to some company and favorite_thing equal to your favorite thing about that company.


### Last thing! Let's print "My favorite thing about working at {work} is {favorite_thing}!". How can we insert two variables and get it to display correctly in the console?
