# Syntax, Comments, Variables, Data Types, & Numbers
#### For unit 1 we just have a simple program where you are adding two variables.

You can try to have this done before the meeting, or we can go over it in the meeting. Or you don't have to at all.

#### To run the program, cd into the directory where unit1.py is, the run `python unit1.py` and there should be text displayed in the terminal once the program completes, which is short.
