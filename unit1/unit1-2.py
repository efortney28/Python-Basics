## Importing a built-in library we will use
import datetime

### Create a variable named "start_date" and set it equal to "datetime.date(2021, 8, 16)"


### Create a second variable named "now" and set it equal to todays date, eg "datetime.date(2022, 2, 1) for February 1, 2022."


### Finally, create a third variable named "total_days" and set it equal to the difference of "now" and "start_date"


### Lastly, let's display the result in the console! But I can't seem to remember the function to display to the console....
("I have spent {0} days working at Google.".format(total_days.days))
